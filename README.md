# iOS-CalculatorApp
One of my biggest iOS projects yet. I grabbed an open source template from here, GitHub from AppBrewery, and after changing their layout, I was able to hard code a Calculator, from scratch, and this is one of many more functional apps that are soon to come.

## How to run code
For this code to work, download it and open it with Xcode 12.3. Once you've done that, you can either open it with an iPhone simulator on your Mac, or you can sign off
and try running it on your physical iPhone device. 

## Xcode 12.3
This program was coded on Xcode 12.3, meaning it can run on any iOS devices iOS 14.3 and above (but of course, you can turn down the iOS version manually).
To download Xcode 12.3, visit : https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ and download their latest release on your compatible device.

## Template Credits
The open source template and/or images I used was from here GitHub, whereby I cloned their existing project to acquire the images that I needed to make this app
work. I owe credit to them for allowing me to use their images, however everything thereby was hardcoded by yours truly. Link to the template is : https://github.com/appbrewery/Calculator-Layout-iOS13 made by AppBrewery.
